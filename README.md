# odin-recipes
i am going to create a basic html website with a homepage and links to 3
webpages containing different food recipes.
I will demonstrate all the skills i have learned so far such as my git 
knowledge including adding and pushing and writing commit messagages.
I will also display all my html skills including creating headings, lists
paragraphs, etc. and also adding links and images.
